Barebones and hackish Python interface for Matveev and company's
Spine_, aka The 3-manifold Recognizer.  Specifically, it lets one use
Spine's recognize feature progammatically from Python by driving the
Windows GUI using pywinauto_.  As with Spine itself, this Python module
is only tested on Windows.  It might be possible to adapt this for use
on Linux or macOS via WINE_, but who knows.  

Install into any Windows version of Python via the following command
in this directory::

  python -m pip install .

and then look at the `test.py` script for some usage examples.
