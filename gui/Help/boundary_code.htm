<H1>Description of the boundary</H1>

<P>
Below you find a description of the induced cell decomposition 
of the boundary of a regular neighborhood of <a href="example-spine.htm">this spine</a>:

Boundary is connected - Sphere

<P>
The meaning of these data is as follows. A regular neighborhood of a special spine P
is equipped with a natural retraction onto P such that the pre-image of every 2-cell 
consists of two 2-cells, the pre-image of each edge, of three edges, and the pre-image 
of each vertex, of four vertices. The pre-images of the j-th edge are numbered j_1, j_2, 
and j_3. The orientations of these edges are such 
that the retraction be orientation-preserving. The two pre-images of i-th cell are 
denoted "i+" and "i-". Again, the orientation of a cell must be preserved 
by the retraction. Each cell is given by the sequence of oriented edges along 
which it passes, similar to presentation of cells of a spine 
<A HREF="present_spine.htm#curves">by their boundary curves</A>.
