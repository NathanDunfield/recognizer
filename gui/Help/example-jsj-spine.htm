<H1>Example of a Spine of a Manifold with Nontrivial JSJ</H1>

<P>Below you find a <a href="present_spine.htm">presentation by boundary curves</a> 
of a certain special spine of a certain non-geometric manifold obtained by gluing 
two Seifert manifolds with base surface a disc and two exceptional fibers. These 
Seifert manifolds have toral boundaries, and the Seifert structures induce 
coordinate systems on these boundaries. The gluing is along the following matrix, 
written with respect to those coordinate systems:

1 1

<P>
The spine has 12 vertices, and so 13 cells and 24 edges.
