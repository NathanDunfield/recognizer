<H1>Labelled Molecules</H1>

<P>
A labelled molecule is a graph G some of whose vertices and
edges are equipped with labels of different kind. Labeled 
vertices are called atoms. There are five types of vertices: 

<UL>
<LI> Solid torus vertices. They have  valence 1 and are shown
as fat black dots.

<LI> Mobius vertices. They are of valence 2 and labeled by
white circles.

<LI> Triple vertices. They have valence 3 and no label.

<LI> Exceptional vertices. Each such vertex stands for
an oriented 3-manifold X, whose boundary consists of spheres and
tori. We assume that there is a fixed  bijection between the
boundary tori of X and the edges of G having an endpoint at the 
vertex (if an edge has both endpoints at the vertex, then it 
corresponds to two boundary tori). The boundary tori which are 
joined by edges with vertices of types 1--4 are equipped with 
coordinate systems.

<LI> Virtual vertices. They are of valence 1 and are not labeled.
</UL> 

<P>
These labels have the following meaning. Vertices of the first three
types correspond to standard 3-manifolds and are considered as
known atoms. Each Mobius atom is an oriented S^1-bundle
over a once punctured Mobius strip. The boundary tori are equipped 
with coordinate systems so that the meridians are
the boundary components of a section of the bundle while the
longitudes are fibers. The meridians and longitudes are oriented
so that the intersection numbers of the meridian with the
corresponding longitudes are equal. There are eight choices of
such orientations. Any two of them are related by a homeomorphism of
the atom. 
</P>

<P>
Triple vertices correspond  to direct products N of twice punctured 
discs by the circle. <a name="systemN2">We introduce coordinate systems on the
boundary tori of N</a> as follows: the meridians are the
boundary circles of an oriented section endowed with the induced
orientations. The longitudes are oriented fibers, and the
intersection numbers of the meridians with the corresponding
longitudes are equal. Any two such triples of coordinate systems
differ by a homeomorphism of N.
</P>

<P>
Of course, solid torus vertices correspond to solid tori. Each such
torus V  must be labeled by an ordered pair
(p,q) of coprime integers. These integers are the coordinates of
the meridian of V in some coordinate system on the boundary of V. 
An explicit  presentation of this system is not needed. We only require that 
the matrix label (see below) for the incoming or outgoing edge must be
written with respect to the same system.
</P>

<P>
Exceptional atoms can correspond to  known 3-manifolds, for
example, to hyperbolic 3-manifolds contained in known tables
or to complements of tabulated knots. They can also correspond to 3-manifolds
which are unknown in the sense that we only know their spines.
</P>

<P>
Virtual vertices correspond to empty atoms. They are introduced to
indicate the valences  of other atoms and stand for their toral
boundary components.
</P>

<P>
The edges of G are also of one of two types: true edges  
with vertices of types 1--4 and virtual edges that have a virtual vertex. 
Each true edge e is oriented and labeled by an order 2 matrix A with 
determinant +1 or -1. We can reverse the orientation of e, but then 
A must be replaced by its inverse. Notice that virtual edges are endowed 
by coordinate systems. In case of the surgery presentation, these coordinate systems 
are the canonical ones, otherwise they are constructed by the program 
according to its internal procedure (and so do not have any particular meaning). 
In the second case the construction of such non-canonical systems can be 
disabled by deselecting "Options|Always Create Coordinates On Boundary Tori".
</P>

<P>
Every labelled molecule G determines a connected
3-manifold M(G), whose boundary consists of spheres and tori. To
reconstruct M(G), we replace each vertex v of type 1--4 by a
copy of the corresponding manifold. The boundary tori of this
manifold are parameterized by the edges that have an endpoint in
v. If e is a true edge then the corresponding tori are
equipped with coordinate systems, and e is labeled with a
matrix. We glue together the manifolds that correspond to the
endpoints of e via the homeomorphism described by the matrix.
Of course, if G is disconnected, then so is the obtained
3-manifold M(G). In this case we replace it by the connected
sum of all its components (since we are considering only oriented
manifolds, the connected sum is well-defined).
