<h1>Recognition Options</h1>

<P>
While performing recognition, there are several options to choose from. The most basic one is the 
one called by going to "Recognizer|Recognize". The other options can be called by going to 
"Recognizer|Recognize In Mode". The presence of these options is due to the fact that the 
same manifold can be presented in different ways. For example, the manifold (S^2,(2,1),(3,1),(9,1),(1,-1) )
can also be presented as the Dehn filling <a href="example-hyp.htm">Q5_43(0,1)</a>. Accordingly, 
the program allows to carry out the recognition in the following modes:
<UL>
<LI> "Till First Presentation". The program works until it finds <i>some</i> presentation 
of the manifold in question and then stops. Which of the possible presentations will be found 
is more or less a matter of chance;

<LI> "Till Main Presentation". If this option is chosen, the recognition stops only when the 
Seifert or Waldhausen presentation is found (for closed manifolds). 

<LI> "Try To Find All Presentations". The program tries to present the manifold in all ways possible.
For example, running this command on <a href="example-spine.htm">this spine</a> yields:
<PRE>
Presentations	3

 SL_2R	          H_1=Z_3
	1	Seifert manifold (S^2,(2,1),(3,1),(9,1),(1,-1) )
	2	Dehn filling Q4_2(-1,2)
	3	Dehn filling Q5_43(0,1)
</PRE>

<LI> A separate command "Recognizer|Make Default Moves" exists so that you can try to 
do the recognition as fast as possible: at each step only one move (determined in fixed order 
of preference among all moves available at this point) will be performed. Application of this 
command (when it leads to a successful recognition) yields the <a href="molecule.htm">labelled molecule</a>
and the result of assembling.
</UL>
</P>


<P>
Further options apply to the way the recognition process is carried out. Namely, choosing 
"Options|Disable Surgeries" will ensure that the recognition process is carried out with 
<a href="moves.htm">surgery moves</a>. But do notice that in this case the recognition process
may not be successful, since surgeries are in fact essential. Thus, this mode is best used when 
your goal is to minimize a spine while keeping it special, rather than to recognize the manifold.
</P>

<P>
If you go to "Options|Try To Simplify Spine Before Recognizing" (by default this option is disabled),
the program first tries to minimize the spine just like it does in the previous case, and only afterwards
applies other moves. This is especially useful when a surgery or Heegaard diagram presentation is 
used.
</P>


<h1>Output Options</h1>

<P>
This refers mainly to whether you want to see the list of transformations that the spine underwent 
during the recognition process. This can be achieved by selecting "Options|Output Move List" prior 
to making the recognition. Also, using the command "Recognizer|Make Default Moves" will 
also provide the list of transformations.
