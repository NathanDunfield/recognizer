<H1>Presentations of 3-manifolds by crystallizations</H1>

<P>
A presentation of a manifold by a crystallization has the following form (this 
is the connected sum of two lens spaces):

</pre>

<P>
The code of a crystallization with 2n vertices consists of three words separated by *.
The words must consist of the first n letters of the Roman alphabet. It is only allowed 
to use lower-case letters. Thus, the maximal number of vertices of any crystallization 
is 52. All three words should be placed in the same line. 
</P>

<P>
Please notice that if the text in the current window contains more than one crystallization 
code then the program takes into account only the first one and ignores the rest.
</P>

<P>
Details on presenting manifolds by crystallizations can be found in <a href="#cryst">[Crystal]</a>.
The program works by first constructing a special spine of the given manifold and then 
operating with it. This spine can be viewed at any moment by going to "Information|Show Boundary Curves".

<P>
If the manifold determined by the crystallization is a connected sum, the program provides 
only the list of connected non-oriented summands (this is actually true for the other types 
of presentations as well). Therefore it is possible to get identical answers for 
non-homeomorphic connected sums. For example, the following two crystallization codes

<PRE>
	fabcdelghijkomn*onjihgfedcbmlka*jimolkdnbafechg
and
	fabcdelghijkomn*onjihgfedcbmlka*jinmlkdobafegch
</PRE>

<P>
correspond to non-homeomorphic connected sums of two copies of the lens space L(3,1).
However, the result of the recognition in both cases is the same:

	A connected sum of 2 items :          H_1=Z_3+Z_3
	Item 1  - L(3,1)
	Item 2  - L(3,1)
