<H1>Presentations of 3-manifolds by Heegaard diagrams</H1>

<P>
Currently the program treats Heegaard diagrams of genus 2, both genuine and extended ones.
</P>

<h2>Genuine Heegaard diagrams of genus 2 </h2>

<P>
These diagrams are presented as follows:
</P>

<PRE>
Heegaard a b c d e f
</PRE>

<P>
where a, b, c, d, e, f are positive integers. For example, inputing "Heegaard 4 2 1 3 8 2" 
yields the following answer:
</P>

<PRE>
Stallings manifold with fiber a torus: ( -2 -1 ) ( -1 -1 )	{1 1 } Sol	          H_1=Z_5+Z
</PRE>

<P>
The meaning of the notation is indicated in the figure below. The numbers a, b, c, d show 
the numbers of relevant arcs. The diagram is considered to be drawn on a 3-ball, and the 
Heegaard diagram is obtained by gluing together the pairs of round discs (in the figure, 
each of the top discs is glued to the one placed right below it), rotating them as the 
numbers e and f indicate. 
</P>

<P>
Please notice that the program treats one diagram at a time, namely, if the text in the current 
window contains more than one Heegaard diagram code, the program takes into 
account only the first one and ignores the rest.
</P>



<h2>Extended Heegaard diagrams of genus 2 </h2>

<P>
These diagrams are presented as follows:
</P>

<PRE>
ExtHeegaard a b c d e f
</PRE>

<P>
where a, b, c, d, e, f are positive integers. For example, inputing "ExHeegaard 9 9 7 8 8 6" 
yields the following answer:
</P>

<PRE>
 Nongeometric	          H_1=Z_2+Z_2
	1	Compound
	Edge 1 { Seifert atom 1 , Seifert atom 2 }	(1 2) (1 1)
Seifert atom 1 (D^2,(2,1),(2,1),(1,0) )
Seifert atom 2 (D^2,(2,1),(3,1),(1,-1) )
	2	Dehn filling Q_3(1,2)
</PRE>

<P>
The meaning of the notation is indicated in the figure below. The two collections, each composed 
of 3 discs and some number of arcs (whose amount is given by numbers a, b, c), are drawn on two 
distinct 3-balls. These balls are then glued together along the pairs of round discs (joined 
by the arrows in the figure). The numbers d, e, f indicate how the discs should be rotated.
</P>

<P>
Once again we mention that the program treats one diagram at a time, namely, if the text 
in the current window contains more than one diagram code, the program takes into 
account only the first one and ignores the rest.
</P>


<h2>Retrievieing information on Heegaard diagrams </h2>

<p>
If you are using the presentation by Heegaard diagrams, you can view some additional information
about it. Namely, if you go to "Information|Short", you can view the following items:
</p>

<ul>
<li> the initial 6-tuple;
<li> the dual 6-tuple if it exists (if it does not, the corresponding message appears);
<li> the tuples obtained by shifting meridians;
<li> for classical diagrams only, you can see the number of curves in the diagram and the 6-tuples
defining each of the curves.
</ul>
