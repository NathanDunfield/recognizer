<H1>Special spine presentations of 3-manifolds</H1>


<H2><A name="curves">Presentation by boundary curves</A></H2>
<P> Assume that you have a special spine P. In order to write down the presentation 
accepted by the program, do the following:
</P>
     
<OL>
<LI> Number the edges of P and orient them;
       
<LI> For each 2-cell choose a basepoint and an orientation on its boundary curve. 
Then write down a string of integers which shows in what order and in which 
direction the boundary curve of the cell passes along the edges.
</OL>

<H3>Example.</H3>

<P> Suppose that P is the spine shown in the figure below. 
It can be constructed as follows. Take the graph with two vertices
and four oriented edges a,b,c,d, where a is a loop with ends in one vertex, 
d is a loop is a loop with ends in the other vertex, and b,c join the vertices.
(The orientations of  b,c are such that they go out of the first vertex.)  Glue 
three 2-cells along the curves abc^{-1}, aacddb^{-1}, bdc^{-1}.  (This CW complex
is actually a special spine of the lens space L(5,1), you can look it up in
the table of manifolds of complexity 2 given in <a href="moves.htm#mbook">[Matveev]</a>). 
If we number edges a,b,c,d respectively with 1,2,3,4 and keep the orientations, then Steps 1 and 2 above   
produce the following presentation:

                          1 1 3 4 4 -2
                          2 4 -3

<P>Remarks. </P>
      
<ol> 
<LI> The minus sign shows that the boundary curve passes along the edge in the direction
opposite to the orientation of the edge.
<LI> Strings corresponding to different cells should be written in different lines.
<LI> The integers in each string should be separated by one or more spaces.
<li> There are some other styles to write a presentation of 2-cell boundary curve,
for example any curve can have <a href="example-hyp-spine.htm">a number</a>
or <a href="spine-after-Tmove.htm">a name</a>. These styles can be viewed in more 
detail by going to "Help|Examples|Three styles of presenting special spines"

<H2><A name="details">Presentation by gluing details</A></H2>

<P>
This is an alternative way of presenting special spines. It is more complicated but it gives 
some idea of how the neighborhood of the singular graph looks like. For example, 
the presentation by gluing details for the above spine is:
</P>

<PRE>
v1 =
	1 : 	v1	_2	 { 1 3 2}	% *** Edge 1 beginning
 %	2 : 	v1	_1	 { 1 3 2}	% *** Edge 1 end
	3 : 	v2	_1	 { 3 1 2}	% *** Edge 2 beginning
	4 : 	v2	_2	 { 3 1 2}	% *** Edge 3 beginning
v2 =
 %	1 : 	v1	_3	 { 2 3 1}	% *** Edge 2 end
 %	2 : 	v1	_4	 { 2 3 1}	% *** Edge 3 end
	3 : 	v2	_4	 { 3 2 1}	% *** Edge 4 beginning
 %	4 : 	v2	_3	 { 3 2 1}	% *** Edge 4 end
</PRE>

<P>
Here v1 and v2 are vertices of the spine, the numbers 1,2,3,4 in the first column of each 
vertex's description denote the four edge germs at each vertex, and the symbol v1 or v2 at the 
next column shows where the corresponding edge goes if we leave out that germ. The triple 
of form {1,3,2} describes the way the triods (comprised of germs of cells) are glued when the 
germs of edges are glued. The symbol % stands for the beginning of an one-line commentary, hence
whatever follows it in the line is not necessary for the program.
